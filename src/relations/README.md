# Relations

## Composite relation
A composite relation occurs between two relations R and S where the second element of a pair in R equals the first element of a pair in S
#### Example
> R = {(1, 2)} , S = {(2, 3)},  S°R = {(1, 3)} 


## Properties of Relations
### Reflexive 
A relation `S` is said to be reflexive on a set `A = {a, b E R}` if `(a, a) E S` and `(b, b) E S`
</br> Basically every element in the set `A` has to have a self pair in the relation `S` for `S` to be reflexive on S
> Reflexive: Set A = {1 , 2} -> S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} 

#### Symmetric
A relation `S` is said to be symmetric on a set `A` if `(a, b) E S` whenever `(b, a) E S`
> Symmetric: S = {(1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (3, 1)}

#### Asymmetric
A relation `S` is said to be asymmetric on a set `A` whenever `(a, b) E S` and `(b, a) E S`, it must be that `a = b`
</br> Basically `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` pairs cannot exist in a relation unless `a = b`
> Asymmetric = S = {(1, 2), (2, 3)}

> #### Transitive
A relation `S` is said to be transitive on a set `A` whenever `(a, b) E S` and `(b, c) E S`, then `(a, c) E S`
</br> Basically if a relation `S` has pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, c)`, if it is transitive, then it must contain a pair `(a, c)`
> Asymmetric = S = {(1, 2), (2, 3)}
